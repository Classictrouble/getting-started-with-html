  <h1> Starting out</h1><h2>what was learned</h2>This <b>first </b>project for <em>Stage 0</em> did not actually explain much on 
what the WEB Page was supposed to contain except to state 
I must show details of what I learned in the first section. <p>As a 
person who types with<strong> two fingers </strong>and occasionally a thumb
 I wondered if I missed some important piece of information,
 but was unable to locate it in the class notesor instructor 
notes.
An image <img scr=http://www.udacity.com/cs253x/himunk.png alt=”hipmunk!”>is
 placed using img and a link for the picture.</p>  I did attempt to add a <a href=”Udacity.com> picture</a> but 
it seems I did not remember something about the address to make it appear. If this
 is incorrect I would appreciate knowing where
I was not looking that I should have been looking . . . <br>so I do not 
miss more instructions in this or future lessons.I was also informed that computers
 are stupid but I believe they are simply absolute on what they interpret.
